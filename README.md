# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to review the production data for AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, with the hope that the findings may help manufacturing.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The first analysis, a linear regression, was run to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of 50 prototype MechaCars based on vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The results of the linear regression were as follows:

Based on the data, we can argue that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on MPG. Although a statistically significant intercept suggests there are other variables that can contribute to variation in MPG, the robust r-squared (and corresponding statistically significant p-value) suggests substantial predictive power given this model. That said, more testing among the explanatory variables is likely needed to confirm independence. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The next analysis looked at descriptive statistics of suspension coil weight capacities to determine if the manufacturing process was consistent across production lots. The results of the analysis are as follows:    

#### Descriptive Statistics for All Lots

#### Descriptive Statistics by Lot

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. At first glance, results for all lots combined suggest that this standard was met. A closer look by lot, however, shows that total performance was driven by lots 1 and 2. Lot 3 did not meet the standard. The manufacturing process was not consistent across production lots.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

A final analysis employed t-tests to determine if the suspension coils for all manufacturing lots and each lot individually were statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch (PSI). The results of the analysis were as follows: 

#### T-Test for All Lots 
![TTest_All_Lots](/TTest_All_Lots.png).

#### T-Test - Lot 1

#### T-Test - Lot 2
![TTest_Lot2](/TTest_Lot2.png).
#### T-Test - Lot 3
![TTest_Lot3](/TTest_Lot3.png).

For the results above, a p-value above our chosen significance level of 0.05 percent suggests that we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. That is, we would argue that the two means are statistically similar. Using this approach, the mean PSI for all lots and lots 1 and 2 are similar to the population mean and the mean PSI for lot 3 is not.  

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

A suggestion for further study would be to compare the performance of the MechaCar vehicles against the performance of vehicles from other manufacturers in these areas: miles per gallon, cost, and longevity. Specifically, the hypotheses to be tested are as follows:
