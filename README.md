# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to review the production data for AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, with the hope that the findings may help manufacturing.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The first aspect of analysis was a linear regression to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of 50 prototype MechaCars based on vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The results of the linear regression are as follows:

Based on the data, we can argue that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on MPG. Although a statistically significant intercept suggests there are other variables that can contribute to variation in MPG, the robust r-squared (and corresponding statistically significant p-value) suggests substantial predictive power given this model.
