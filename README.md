# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to review the production data for AutosRUsâ€™ newest prototype, the MechaCar, with the hope that the findings may help manufacturing.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The first analysis, a linear regression, was run to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of 50 prototype MechaCars based on vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance. The results of the linear regression were as follows:

Based on the data, we can argue that vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on MPG. Although a statistically significant intercept suggests there are other variables that can contribute to variation in MPG, the robust r-squared (and corresponding statistically significant p-value) suggests substantial predictive power given this model. That said, more testing among the explanatory variables is likely needed to confirm independence. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The next analysis were tests of suspension coil weight capacities to determine if the manufacturing process was consistent across production lots. The results of the analysis are as follows:
